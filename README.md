## This is a simple text editor with an amazing functionality to add standard comments in C++ header files

*Add Comments* is a Qt gui text editor. Nothing special rather than two menu actions: `Add Comments` and `Delete Comments`.  `Add Comments` activates when the C++ header file is opened.

Checkout `comment.cpp` to see how it parses text to differ classes, functions and variables.



The application was written when I studied Qt(June 2011) so don't be very exacting against :)
