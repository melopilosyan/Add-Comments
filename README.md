## Add Standard Comments

*Add Comments* is a Qt gui text editor. Nothing special rather than two menu actions: `Add Comments` and `Delete Comments`.  `Add Comments` activates when a C++ header file is opened.

#### Usage
 Download `Add_Comment.zip` from `bin/`, unzip in Unix like OS(Ubuntu is preferable) and run by double clicking.
 Checkout `comment.cpp` to see how it parses text to differ classes, functions and variables.



P. S. The application was written when I studied Qt(June 2011) so don't be very exacting against :wink:
